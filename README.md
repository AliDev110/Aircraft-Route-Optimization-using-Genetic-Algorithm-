# Aircraft Route Optimization using Genetic Algorithm
This project aims to optimize flight routes based on aircraft performance, weather conditions, and fuel efficiency. It uses a genetic algorithm to find the most efficient route between two airports, considering various factors such as aircraft range, fuel consumption, cruise speed, wind speed, and direction.
For implementation details, please refer to the Report (i.e. Report.pdf) and Code (Code.ipynb) files.
### Getting Started
1. Read the Report for a comprehensive overview of the project
2. Explore the Code for implementation details
3. Run the code to optimize flight routes
